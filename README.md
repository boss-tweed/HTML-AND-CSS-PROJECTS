# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS
This repository is for my Tech Academy HTML/CSS course.
It will be used for the sole purpose of publishing coding assignments and projects to become more proficient in HTML and CSS.
These projects will prepare me for future personal projects in these same programming languages, that I will also publish on this site.
