# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS
This repository is for my Tech Academy HTML/CSS course.
It will be used for the sole purpose of publishing coding assignments and projects to become more proficient in HTML and CSS.
These projects will prepare me for future personal projects in these same programming languages, that I will also publish on this site.

## Projects

- These are the projects I completed for this course:
    - Academy Cinemas site
    - Simple Recipes site
    - The Pet Shop site
    - Portfolio Webpage
    - Numerous other small assignments

### Academy Cinemas

This was made in part w/ Bootstrap as a means of understanding how it could be applied. It is a mock movie theater website.

### Simple Recipes

This was made from scratch to help commit syntax and proper form to memory. It is a online recipe webpage.

### The Pet Shop

This was the first site mockup done in the course. It is an online pets store that also includes an individual Contact Us page.

This was the final and longest prjoect. it is a live portfolio website meant to demonstrate to users the owners profiency for writing HTML/CSS code; as a means to attract potential employers.
